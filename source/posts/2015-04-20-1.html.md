It's awesome! I just created [2 branches on Github](https://github.com/rono23/rono23.github.io) and [configured an A record](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/).

### Branches

- `master`: static contents for [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- `develop`: original contents with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)

### Deploy

```
$ bundle exec middleman build
$ bundle exec middleman deploy
```

It's really easy to post articles using markdown and deploy :)
The one thing that I don't like is there is always a slash at the end of url like `/posts/github-pages-x-middleman/` :(
I can remove it when I use `.html` extension, but I don't like either.

I used to use Blogger, Tumblr, Hatena Blog and Lokka, but I gave up easily.. This time I hope I will write once a month at least.
